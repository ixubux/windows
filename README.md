## **Fuck Adobe**
This contains all the bat files to make changes after you pirate adobe using GenP (considered as the most solid way to pirate adobe products.)

## Regs
This contains a reg file making two main changes to a windows PC:
* Disabling auto updates while booting or rebooting windows.
* Enabling the old styled (windwos 10) right click menu back to windows 11.

## Scripts
This contains some really useful and practical scripts to use.
* **disable-bloat-service.ps1** disables some services from services.msc
* **list-disables-services.ps1** shows currently disabled services.
